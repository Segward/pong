# Pong Game

Just started learning SDL2 with C so this is a simple pong game I made to practice.

## Requirements

1. Install SDL2 and SDL2_ttf using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install sdl2 sdl2_ttf
```

2. Have the gcc compiler installed. You can install it using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install gcc
```

## Usage

1. To build the project, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
make build
```

2. To run the game, use the following command:

```bash
make run
```

3. To clean up the build files, use:

```bash
make clean
```
