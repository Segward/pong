# Pong Game

Just started learning SDL2 with C so this is a simple pong game I made to practice.

## Usage

1. Install SDL2 on your system. You can find instructions for your platform [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation).

2. Compile the code using the following command:

```bash
gcc -o pong src/main.c -I/opt/homebrew/include -L/opt/homebrew/lib -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
./pong
```
